            Each item should correspond to a stream name. A stream mentioned here 
            indicates it uses timestamp-based replication. The default for a stream is 
            non-timestamp based since Mongo most often uses epochs. This is required since 
            the determination of timestamp based replication requires the key exist in the 
            jsonschema with a date-like type which is impossible when there is no explicit 
            schema prior to runtime. NOTE: Streams still require `metadata` mapping with an 
            explicit callout of `replication-key` and `replication-method`.
